# Decimal-To-Binary-Converter-in-Logo-Soft-Comfort

This project was a proof to my "PLC" professor that I was worthy of the best grade at his subject
This was just a proof and was not made to be used in a "real life" aplication. 
This program can convert numbers from 0 to 511 (I really cannot remember why 511, this program was made a few years ago)
